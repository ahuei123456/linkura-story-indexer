## Index Rebuilds

Raw evidence is embedded as coalesced retrieval chunks over adjacent source
scenes. The original parsed scene indexes remain in metadata as
`scene_start`, `scene_end`, and `source_scene_count` for citations.

Changing retrieval chunk thresholds or raw metadata schema requires rebuilding
the Chroma index, or pruning stale vectors once Task 9 stale-vector pruning
exists. Otherwise older one-scene records can remain active beside the new
chunk IDs.

Changing the embedding model or embedding input format also requires rebuilding
the Chroma index. The default `gemini-embedding-2` path uses inline retrieval
instructions (`title: ... | text: ...` for documents and
`task: search result | query: ...` for queries), which should not be mixed with
older vectors created from raw text or from a different embedding model.
